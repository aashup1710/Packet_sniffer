## Introduction

A packet sniffer is a network analysis tool used to intercept and capture data packets traveling through a network. It provides essential insights for troubleshooting, security analysis, and protocol examination. By analyzing packet contents, network administrators can identify performance issues and security threats, while developers can debug and optimize network applications. A packet sniffer is an invaluable tool for understanding network behavior, diagnosing problems, and ensuring the efficient and secure operation of computer networks.

## Features

- Packet Capture: Intercept and record data packets from a network for analysis.
- Protocol Decoding: Decode and interpret network protocols, revealing valuable packet information.
- Filtering and Analysis: Focus on specific packets based on criteria, aiding troubleshooting and security investigations.
